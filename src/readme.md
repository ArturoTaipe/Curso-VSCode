Potato late blight (TT), due to the pathogenic oomycete, Phytophthora infestans, can cause
extensive economic damage. Copper is used to combat TT mainly in organic production, but its
reduction or elimination as fungicide is a priority in Europe, and it is already banned in
some countries. Alternative control strategies, including botanicals, could reduce copper an
control TT. We investigated the application of Frangula alnus bark, its sequential use with
reduced copper, and reduced copper applications alone in field and lab experiments. Different
dosages and preparations influenced F. alnus efficacy and the quantity of its posited active
ingredients. Through in vitro and in planta experiments, we investigated whether F. alnus
directly or indirectly controlled TT. A bacterium (Erwinia spp.), originating from the F. alnus
extract, colonized the media and caused most of the direct inhibition in vitro, but filtering out
microorganisms had no effect on the extractâ€™s efficacy in planta. The contribution of
extract-associated microorganisms to TT control is unclear and requires additional
experimentation to assess. The measured anthraquinones likely contributed to the effect
of F. alnus. During four years of field experiments, the reduced copper and F. alnus treatments
decreased disease severity in four and in three of the years, respectively, compared to the water
control. No differences in disease severity or yield were observed between full and reduced
copper treatments. Potato variety more consistently drove differences in total and marketable
yields compared to the treatment. The yield was relatively stable within each year, suggesting
that the treatment's effect on yield is intertwined with the timing of disease development
and environmental conditions.
